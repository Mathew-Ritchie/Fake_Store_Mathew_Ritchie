# My Fake Store

## About

This is a side project using fakestoreapi.com. I am fetching the data from the API and I am in the process of designing and building a basic online fake store.

## Setup

npm Istall

nmp run dev

## What I have done so far

    1. I have created a global store, which I am using to fetch, sort and filter the product data from the API.
    2. I have two main product components at the moment. The first is StoreItems.jsx which is used to display all available products after sorting and filtering. The second is the ProductDescriptionCard.jsx which shows all the information for an individual product that was clicked on.
    3. I am currently using local Storage to house the data for a cart of items the user has clicked on to buy, and also a favourites where the user stores their favourite items.

## What I am currently working on

    1. Favourites and cart pages.
